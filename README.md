## Why Play Skunked?

### ⚡ Pick Up and Play in Seconds

Open a browser tab and you're in. No app store. No 4 GB download. No account. No waiting. Runs on any device with a modern browser — your phone, your laptop, your kid's tablet, your VR headset.

### 🥷 Be the Ninja Skunk

You're not just *any* skunk — you're a **shadow-striking, combo-chaining, boss-slaying ninja**. Tight, responsive controls reward skill and aggression. Every hit feels crunchy. Every dodge feels earned.

### 💀 Shadow Strike

Your signature move. Dash through enemies with devastating force and invulnerability frames. Time it right and you'll carve through an entire wave. Time it wrong and… well, skunks have more than one life.

### 🏆 Chase the High Score

Every enemy you defeat feeds your combo meter. Chain attacks without getting hit to rack up massive multipliers. Compete against yourself — or brag to your friends. The leaderboard doesn't lie.

### 🎮 Play Your Way

| Platform | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Desktop** | Keyboard — Arrow keys, Space, X, Z. Instant and precise. |
| **Mobile / Tablet** | On-screen touch buttons appear automatically. Optimized for thumbs. |
| **Meta Quest VR** | Point-and-click with controllers or use the on-screen touch UI with the laser. Full WebXR bridge support. |
| **Gamepad** | Xbox and standard controllers auto-detected. A = Jump, Trigger = Attack, B = Special. |

### 🗺️ Three Stages of Mayhem

Progress through increasingly brutal levels. Each stage introduces new enemy types, tighter platforming, and bigger bosses with unique AI that will punish predictable play. Survive them all and prove you're the real deal.

### 🎁 Loot & Power-Ups

- **Health Regen** — green pickups that heal over time
- **Extra Lives** — red hearts to keep you in the fight
- **Golden Idols** — collect all three in a level for stacked speed, damage, and survival bonuses

### 🎵 Full Soundtrack

Original procedurally generated music and sound effects bring every punch, jump, and explosion to life. Metal guitar riffs kick in when things heat up.
